## Social Networks
### Instagram
<img width="16" src="misc/forbidden.png"> </img> Don't use instagram (or at least the official client). Instagram is a very privacy-invasive app with biased results and feeds based on user profiles, it is also used as a manipulation tool and has a lot of censorship going against free speech. Lastly, it has an addictive and toxic ui-design.

<img width="16" src="misc/check.png"> </img> **Instead Use:**

It never shows you [alternative opinions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08313.pdf) to your ideology/bias. Youtube censors a lot.

<img width="16" src="misc/check.png"> </img> **Alternatives to Twitter:**
